=== Source datasets (pre-merge) overview ===

1) Airbnb dataset (Raw Data folder)
- Number of city-daytype files: 20
- Total rows across files: 51707
- Columns (count): 20 columns: ['Unnamed: 0', 'realSum', 'room_type', 'room_shared', 'room_private', 'person_capacity', 'host_is_superhost', 'multi', 'biz', 'cleanliness_rating', 'guest_satisfaction_overall', 'bedrooms', 'dist', 'metro_dist', 'attr_index', 'attr_index_norm', 'rest_index', 'rest_index_norm', 'lng', 'lat']
- Distinct cities from filenames: ['amsterdam', 'athens', 'barcelona', 'berlin', 'budapest', 'lisbon', 'london', 'paris', 'rome', 'vienna']
- Distinct day types from filenames: ['weekdays', 'weekends']
- City and DayType are not stored as columns; they are encoded in filenames (e.g., athens_weekdays).
- Main features include pricing (realSum), room/bedrooms/capacity, host/superhost flags,
  cleanliness and guest satisfaction ratings, distance/attractiveness indices, and geo-coordinates.

2) Crime dataset (Indices folder)
- Rows: 453
- Columns (count): 4 columns: ['Rank', 'City', 'Crime Index', 'Safety Index']
- Relevant columns: City, Crime Index, Safety Index (Rank column is irrelevant).
- City values combine city and country in one string (e.g., 'London, United Kingdom').
- Duplicate city labels: None

3) Preprocessing challenges before merging
- Different storage of city name: Airbnb uses filenames; crime data uses 'City, Country' strings.
- Case/whitespace differences require normalizing to lowercase and stripping spaces.
- Country suffix in crime data must be split off to align with Airbnb city names.
- Duplicate city label (London) needs disambiguation to keep the intended country.
- Building a consistent merge key (cleaned city name) is required for a reliable join.

4) Why extract and clean city names for merging
- Without extracting city from filenames and stripping country from crime data, keys would not match.
- Normalizing case/whitespace prevents missed matches due to formatting.
- Removing duplicate/ambiguous entries (e.g., London, Canada) avoids incorrect joins.
