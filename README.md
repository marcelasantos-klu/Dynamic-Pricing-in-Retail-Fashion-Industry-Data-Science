Objective (Final Version):
Analyze and model fashion retail product data to understand key drivers of product performance (sales, interest, profitability) and develop predictive models that help optimize inventory, pricing, and assortment.

Project tasks (aligned with the assignment guide):
1) Business and data understanding
- Define the core business question (e.g., demand forecast, price elasticity, margin optimization) and target variable(s).
- Summarize the dataset: entities, granularity, time span, and each column’s role; note any external sources you plan to add (e.g., holidays, weather, promotions).
- Run EDA to see distributions, correlations, seasonality, and how features relate to the target; identify potential segments (e.g., category, brand, collection).

2) Data preparation
- Clean data: handle missing values, duplicates, outliers, data types, and currency/units; document any rows removed.
- Encode/scale/normalize as needed; create train/validation/test splits that respect time (if applicable) and balance classes if classification.
- Engineer features relevant to pricing and demand (e.g., discount depth, time since launch, season, stock position, competitor price proxies, lag/rolling stats).

3) Modeling
- Establish a simple baseline (e.g., mean/median, naive seasonal forecast, logistic baseline) for comparison.
- Train multiple model families with parameter variation (e.g., linear/elastic net, tree-based models such as RF/GBM/XGBoost, regularized GLMs, and, if useful, a time-series or panel model). Consider an unsupervised step (clustering segments) to inform features or pricing groups.
- Track experiments and hyperparameters; compare how feature choices and model classes affect performance.

4) Evaluation
- Use suitable metrics for the task (e.g., MAE/RMSE/SMAPE for regression; accuracy/F1/ROC-AUC/PR-AUC for classification; business KPIs such as expected margin or stock-out risk).
- Apply cross-validation or time-based splits; highlight how evaluation method changes results. Include calibration checks and error analysis (by category/season/price band).
- Present performance against the baseline and between models; explain trade-offs and when each model is preferable.

5) Documentation and reflection
- Keep code commented and reproducible (scripts or notebook) with clear step ordering.
- Write up decisions, assumptions, and limitations; note issues like data leakage risks, feature availability at prediction time, and fairness/segment impacts.
- Reflect on how good the final model is, what else could be done next, and lessons learned.

Deliverables (per guide)
- Presentation (~5 minutes): problem, dataset, approach, key results, and takeaways.
- Python implementation: executable code plus required data/notebook; comments explaining each step.
- Report (about 3–4 pages per team member): cover all tasks above with plots/graphs for data, analyses, and results; include reflection on performance and next steps.
- Oral defense readiness: every team member can explain and justify choices across data prep, modeling, and evaluation.

Checklist to satisfy assessment criteria
- Problem is well framed in both domain and technical terms; dataset complexity is appropriate.
- Data is properly prepared (encodings, balancing, handling NaNs/outliers) and documented.
- Techniques and evaluation metrics fit the problem; multiple models and parameter variations tested.
- Choices are explained in the report; structure and flow are clear.
- Team can justify design decisions and discuss limitations in an oral defense.

Feature to be added: seasonality discount based on the purchase date, external brand popularity score

# Competitor Price Scraping (Huge for pricing models)
Why it’s powerful:
If you scrape similar products from H&M, Zalando, Zara, ASOS…
You can create:
	•	Competitive price ratio
	•	Market average price
	•	Price gap vs market

Merge key:
	•	Category
	•	Brand
	•	Product keywords

Insights you get:
	•	Price elasticity
	•	Price competitiveness
	•	Predicted margin impact
	•	Improved price prediction models
